There are many people to thank but the one which can't go unmentioned is Claus Kleinwort. Much of the linear algebra is taken from his notes. I have hopefully understood, accurately described, and applied this knowledge. I should also thank him for the consistent correspondence which has taught me most of what I know about fitting.
